# Master of magic unit balance mod

Attempt to modify normal unit stats to make them more sensible and usable.

_Disclaimer_

Master of magic is a great game of all times! ðŸ˜€

# Intent

To enhance normal unit playing variativity, usability, and restore game depth to designed lore.

# Problem statement

There are three major unit groups in the game: normal units, summoned units and heroes. Summoned units and heroes acceptably balanced to the level that they form their corresponding strategies. Whereas normal units just plain suck. There are few factors contributing to this.

* Normal units food upkeep burden is impossible at any stage of the game but most pronouncely at the beginning. Some average 5 size town can barely upkeep two spearmen garrison while it grows and advance infrastructure through two thirds of the game until it can support basic military. That is laughable.
* Normal archetipical units do not have good strength spread and do not have good middle strength representation. All these swordsmen, halebardiers, bowmen, shaman, cavalery are about the same strength, about same cost and plain suck when you are able to build them. Player has no insentive to pick one or the other.
* A lot of high end normal units are pretty awfully balanced. Especially those 1-2 figure super unit requiring immense infrastructure investments may be worse a middle tier one. Extreme example: Javeliners vs. Dragon Turtle. The latter is more costly and more difficult to achieve but is noticeably weaker. That again does not give player incentive to develop infrastructure. Thus shallowing game to pretty simple and repetitive play removing strategical advancement element from the game and making it much less replayable.

Which is sad.

# Proposed solution

First and foremost: reduce army food upkeep. Currently I am trying 1/2 food upkeep per unit. Could be still high. May also try 1/4.

Spread archetipical normal units more evenly across strenght/cost scale giving player a meaningful choice between strength and abilities.

Adjust high end units in each race to make right infrastructure to strenght progression. Further investment into infrastructure should result in stronger units.

Adjust high end units to make them strong enough to be able to fight strongest lairs and nodes. In vanilla they are pretty incapable and a lot of strong lairs/nodes just stay sealed until the end of the game. Unless strong enough heroes can crack them, of course.

Adjust unit cost so that economy deprived races have them at relatively lower cost. Like lizardmen should have relatively strong but cheap units as this the only advantage they have.

# Archetypical unit change

Halberdiers becomes seriously stronger and well protected. Rest of melee units is adjusted to be about proportinally distributed between spearmen and pikemen.

Bowmen and shaman are increased in strength. Priests melee is slightly reduced. They are now more proportionally distributed on bowment - magician scale.

|type|melee|ranged|defense|
|:----|----:|----:|----:|
|spearmen|1||2|
|swordsmen|3||3|
|cavalry|6||2|
|halberdiers|6||6|
|pikemen|7||5|
|bowmen|1|2|1|
|shamans|2|3|3|
|priests|2|4|3|
|magicians|1|5|3|

# Racial unit changes

I am not going to list them all here. Few key points.

All races high end units are now in about same class. Recruit slingers are somewhat weaker but they benefit greatly from unit buff due to 8 figures as in vanilla.

All races high end units are now stronger than middle tier units.

Orc Cavalry receives +1 hit point due to lack of their first strike ability.

Barbarian Cavalry receives +2 thrown to keep them aligned with other units.

Lizardman Javelineers melee capacity is reduced to keep them adequately priced.

# Pricing

## Dark Elves

Price multiplier changed to x3.0. They seem to be still too strong at x2.5.

## Dwarves

Price multiplier changed to x3.0. They have immense production power.
