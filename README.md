## Races unit economical effectiveness

Some races are economically advantageous and can produce units faster and support more of them. Here is the estimate how effective racial units should be. Higher number defines higher fighting power per cost.

|:----|----:|:----|
|Orcs|1.0||
|Barbarians|1.2|Very economically disadvantageous race except the fastest growth.|
|Beastmen|1.0||
|Dark Elves|1.0|Grow slow but extra mana intake that can be used to summon units and strengthen normal units.|
|Draconians|1.0||
|Dwarves|0.8|The best producers in the game with multiple additional bonuses.|
|Gnolls|1.5|The most economically disadvantageous race.|
|Halflings|1.0||

|High Men|1.0||
|Klackons|0.8|Powerful producers.|
