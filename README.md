# Master of magic unit balance mod

Attempt to modify normal unit stats to make them more sensible and usable.

_Disclaimer_

Master of magic is a great game of all times! ðŸ˜€

# Intent

To enhance normal unit playing variativity, usability, and restore game depth to designed lore.

# Problem statement

There are three major unit groups in the game: normal units, summoned units and heroes. Summoned units and heroes acceptably balanced to the level that they form their corresponding strategies. Whereas normal units just plain suck. There are few factors contributing to this.

* Normal units food upkeep burden is impossible at any stage of the game but most pronouncely at the beginning. Some average 5 size town can barely upkeep two spearmen garrison while it grows and advance infrastructure through two thirds of the game until it can support basic military. That is laughable.
* Normal archetipical units do not have good strength spread and do not have good middle strength representation. All these swordsmen, halebardiers, bowmen, shaman, cavalery are about the same strength, about same cost and plain suck when you are able to build them. Player has no insentive to pick one or the other.
* A lot of high end normal units are pretty awfully balanced. Especially those 1-2 figure super unit requiring immense infrastructure investments may be worse a middle tier one. Extreme example: Javeliners vs. Dragon Turtle. The latter is more costly and more difficult to achieve but is noticeably weaker. That again does not give player incentive to develop infrastructure. Thus shallowing game to pretty simple and repetitive play removing strategical advancement element from the game and making it much less replayable.

Which is sad.

# Proposed solution

First and foremost: reduce army food upkeep. Currently I am trying 1/2 food upkeep per unit. Could be still high. May also try 1/4.

Spread archetipical normal units more evenly across strenght/cost scale giving player a meaningful choice between strength and abilities.

Adjust high end units in each race to make right infrastructure to strenght progression. Further investment into infrastructure should result in stronger units.

Adjust high end units to make them strong enough to be able to fight strongest lairs and nodes. In vanilla they are pretty incapable and a lot of strong lairs/nodes just stay sealed until the end of the game. Unless strong enough heroes can crack them, of course.

Adjust unit cost so that economy deprived races have them at relatively lower cost. Like lizardmen should have relatively strong but cheap units as this the only advantage they have.

# Archetypical unit change

## Basic unit to be aligned

I consider these units as archetypical representation.

* spearmen: Orc Spearmen
* swordsmen: Orc Swordsmen
* cavalry: High Men Cavalry (with first strike)
* halberdiers: Orc Halberdiers
* pikemen: High Men Pikemen
* bowmen: Orc Bowmen
* shaman: Orc Shaman
* priests: High Men Priests
* magicans: Orc Magicians (4 figures)

Taking Orc Magicians as basis strength of strongest archetypical unit. High Men magicians are stronger but this is more like racial specifics.

## Proposed distribution

### Melee

(High Men) Pikemen should be about same strength as (Orc) magicians or maybe somewhat stronger. The rest of melee units should be about proportionally distributed in strength between spearmen and pikemen.

* spearmen
* swordsmen
* cavalry
* halberdiers
* pikemen

### Ranged

(Orc) magicians are same as in vanilla. The rest of ranged units should be about proportionally distributed in strength between bowmen and magician. The exact strength of bowmen comparing to melee units could be somewhere around swordsmen or maybe just slightly stronger.

* bowmen
* shaman
* priests
* magicians

## Proposed changes

Halbardiers become much stronger than cavalry. Therefore, their cost model changes too.

|type|melee|ranged|defense|
|:----|----:|----:|----:|
|spearmen||||
|swordsmen|+1||+1|
|cavalry|+1|||
|halberdiers|+2||+3|
|pikemen|+2||+1|
|bowmen||+1||
|shamans||+1||
|priests|-1||-1|
|magicians||||

# Racial unit changes

Only specific racial changes besides above archetypical changes are listed here.

## Barbarians

Bowmen and shamans receive +1m to compensate for lack of thrown weapon. Otherwise, they are undistinguishable from basic unit and should be priced less. This way they are in line with other units.

Swordsmen receive +1 thrown to keep them proportionally stronger.

Cavalery receives +2 thrown to keep them proportionally stronger.

Berserkers: **11m 6t 4d**.

## Gnolls

Wolf Riders: **11m 5d**

## Halflings

Generally all units are somewhat weaker and more expensive due to their extra harvest ability that translates to bigger armies.

Slingers receive +1 ranged to stay in line with bowmen and shamans. Even with this improvement they are no match with other races high end units unless super enchanted, as always.

## High Elves

Elven Lords: **7m 5d** to stay in line with generally improved cavalry.

Pegasai: **7m 5r 5d**. They were pretty pathetic in vanilla not worth infrastructure investments. Now they are good air support.

## High Men

Paladins: unchanged! They are very strong but increasing other races high end units created enough competition.

## Klackons

Stag Beetle: **20m 10f 10d**. With only one unit they were quite weak in vanilla. Now they are comparable to others.

## Lizardmen

Shamans receive their well deserved +1d racial bonus. Strangely they didn't in vanilla.

Javelineers: **3m 3r 3d**. Insanely powerful unit comparable to the most high end ones. It should not be, though. I let them keep their ranged attack as definitve feature but reduced melee and defense to tone them down a little.

Dragon Turtle: **15m 10f 10d 20h**. Pathetic vanilla unit not worth investment now overtakes Javeliners and can fight the toughest fantastic creatures.

## Nomads

Horsebowmen: **6m 3r 3d**. Improved to keep in line with improved bowmen and cavalry.

Rangers: **4m 5r 4d** (+2r). One of the best ranged unit in game both by lore and name (!) should have some decent ranged attack.

Griffins: no change. Surprisingly, pretty decent vanilla unit.

## Orcs

Cavalry gets +1h. It lacks first strike unlike other races cavalry units making it somewhat weak. I desided to give them extra health instead imagining orcs would ride some meaty and fleshy "horses". ðŸ˜‰

Wyvern Riders: **7m 7d**.

## Beastmen

Centaurs: **4m 3r 3d**. Added some attack power to keep in line with bowmen and cavalry.

Manticores: **9m 7d**. Just bringing them in line with sub high end level.

Minotaurs: **14m 6d**. Slight strength increase. Not mandatory chagne. They are strong as were. I just feel sorrow for them to be shot to death while they are walking toward the shooters.

## Dark Elves

Nightblades: **6m 4d**. Slight strenght increase. I never felt compelled building them.

Warlocks: unchanged. The strongest unit in game by many people opinion. I let them be but seriously increased their cost so player cannot flood plains with them. They should stay rare.

Nightmares: unchanged.

## Draconians

Bowmen and shamans receive +1m to compensate for lack of fire breath. Otherwise, they are undistinguishable from basic unit and should be priced less. This way they are in line with other units.

Doom Drakes: unchanged.

Air Ship: **10m 15r 5d**. Previously relatively weak unit not worth investment. Now adequate air support. However, I may be wrong here and its speed and flying may be good enough properties to not strengthen it even more. Let me know your opinion.

## Dwarves

Hammerhands: unchanged.

Golem: **16m 12d**. Previously overlooked underpowered unit due to the single figure. Requires serious boost to become viable.

## Trolls

War Trolls: unchanged.

War Mammoths: **12m 8d**. Again, overlooked underpowered unit due to few figures. Got slight boost.

# Pricing

## Dark Elves

Price multiplier changed to x3.0. They seem to be still too strong at x2.5.

## Dwarves

Price multiplier changed to x3.0. They have immense production power.
